            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <P>My name is Jareth. I was born in the eastern united states and served my mission in the Colorado Denver south Mission. I am currently a systems administrator, a father, a health fanatic, a board game designer, a temple attendee and more. I believe that the three year degree option through BYU Pathways is a great opportunity and I hope to make the most of it.</P>

                <p>The United States is a country that is only 248 years old - but despite that what has started small has grown to over 50 states and territories and has established a system of government and constitution that has made a difference in many places all over the world. Just recently in my area I got to experience a solar eclipse - during the event I watched the sun and clouds, held swordfights with my family, and kissed my wife. At one point the clouds covered the eclipse so much that we actually did not need our glasses for about a minute or two.</p>
