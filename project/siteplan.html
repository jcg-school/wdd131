        <div class="site-purpose border">
            <p>The purpose of this site is to introduce players already familiar with the table-top role-playing market to a family style rpg in the realm of Hylandia based on a 2d10 die system that aims to use game mechanics and planning structures that support a narrative-first high fantasy role-playing game.</p>

        <div class="target-audience border">
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>The target audience is experienced role-players interested in a family-oriented game for gentle learning and fun. either this block or an extended header will have a button inviting viewers to learn more. this block will really be turned into "Scenario0" where the core ideas behind our game design are explained.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario1 border">
            <h2>What is Hylandia? What about the city called "Sanctuary"? What is the shadowfeel?</h2>
            <p>This section will give an overral explanation of the realm of Hylandia. It will have hover-able or clickable buttons that, using javascript and template literals change the main body of text to go more-in-depth on certain specifics of the world.</p>
            <p>The shadowfeel is a realm of darkness that mirrors our own. Mutated creatures of living shadow thrive off of the negative habits, thought processes, and feelings that feel their way through the shadow-veil. As these things grow they eventually gain the power to manifest into the interactable world - threatening safety, peace of mind, and more. Each shadowfeel creature has different instincts and drives, and represents different feelings and human aspects that need to be countered for peace, happiness, and productivity to reign. While many can be weakened, fought, or even tamed, there are some aberrant creatures that are uncatalogued (or at least, poorly known) and difficult to handle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario2 border">
            <h2>What are some example characters?</h2>
            <p>Example characters will be an array of objects (character cards) each containing a profile image, stats, a concept, , a party role (tank, sneak, bomb, fighter, healer) a species, and equipment. You will be able to filter them by stat threshhold, role, or species.</p>

            <h2>What Monsters & Beasties Can I Expect to See?</h2>
            <p>This section will provide information on a few cool creatures that could be seen. It will be a gallery of images that each has an overlay with descriptive text including a name, home, instincts, and miscellaneous details.</p>
            <div class="monster-card border">
                <img src="#" alt="dreadlegs backdrop" loading="lazy">
                <p>The dreadlegs is a massive spider with ten eyes and ten legs from the shadowfeel realm - it feeds off of anxiety, fear, and unsurety. While it can be weakened by working to calm those nearby or involved, once one of these spawn it needs to be faced head on - paralytic bite and all. When a dreadlegs manifests it prefers to find dark corners that have enough height to keep it off the ground. Rather than attack head on, dreadlegs usually sit, watch, and wait continuing to feed on growing fear until it decides it is time ot move on.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="color-schema border">
            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>The base background color will be based on a soft contemplative brown. This is because this game isn't just about fun, chaos, fellowship, and challenge - but also learning. It will be paired with a soft off-white for text, contrast, and general emphasis. Despite this the real primary color of the site will be a yellow for emphasis on important areas that feels appropriate to encouraging feelings of fun, and a vibrant purple for invitations to action. the final anf fifth color is really just a change in hover effects to highlight and light up action buttons, as I want to maintain a generally softer theme even on the action buttons until someone is considering (hovering over) taking action - the focus here is more about community than sales.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="typography border">
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The heading will be one appropriate for a "natural fantasy" style rpg game without being too flowery. The base text will be appealing and unique, with a backup of serif.</p>

        <div class="wireframes border">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Below are the example wireframes for how the webpage design will look on differing screen sizes.</p>
