        <div class="sitepurpose">
            <p>The purpose of this site is to introduce players already familiar with the table-top role-playing market to a family style rpg in the realm of Hylandia based on a 2d10 die system that aims to use game mechanics and planning structures that support a narrative-first high fantasy role-playing game.</p>
        </div>

    <main>
        <div class="targetaudience">
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>The target audience is experienced role-players interested in a family-oriented game for gentle learning and fun. either this block or an extended header will have a button inviting viewers to learn more. this block will really be turned into "Scenario0" where the core ideas behind our game design are explained.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario1">
            <h2>What is Hylandia? What about the city called "Sanctuary"?</h2>
            <p>This section will give an overral explanation of the realm of Hylandia. It will have hover-able or clickable buttons that, using javascript and template literals change the main body of text to go more-in-depth on certain specifics of the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario2">
            <h2>What are some example characters?</h2>
            <p>Example characters will be an array of objects (character cards) each containing a profile image, stats, a concept, , a party role (tank, sneak, bomb, fighter, healer) a species, and equipment. You will be able to filter them by stat threshhold, role, or species.</p>
            <div class="examplecharacter">
                <h3>Bob</h3>
                <p><i></i></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="colorschema">
            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>The base background color will be based on a soft contemplative brown. This is because this game isn't just about fun, chaos, fellowship, and challenge - but also learning. It will be paired with a soft off-white for text, contrast, and general emphasis. Despite this the real primary color of the site will be a yellow for emphasis on important areas that feels appropriate to encouraging feelings of fun, and a vibrant purple for invitations to action. the final anf fifth color is really just a change in hover effects to highlight and light up action buttons, as I want to maintain a generally softer theme even on the action buttons until someone is considering (hovering over) taking action - the focus here is more about community than sales.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="typography">
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The heading will be one appropriate for a "natural fantasy" style rpg game without being too flowery. The base text will be appealing and unique, with a backup of serif.</p>
